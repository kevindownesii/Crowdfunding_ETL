# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project 2 is an Extract, Transform, & Load (ETL) pipeline utilizing Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expression. 

Two starter files were provided (crowdfunding.xslx and contacts.xslx) which were utilized to create four CSV files (category, subcategory, campaign, contacts).

Utilizing jupyter notebook, code was written to extract, transform, and load data into the csv files for database intergation with pgAdmin. 

Using quickdatabasediagrams.com, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created for the 4 CSV files establishing both primary and foregin keys. A table schema from the ERD was created. 

SELECT * FROM statements were used to verify the data uploads were accurate.
